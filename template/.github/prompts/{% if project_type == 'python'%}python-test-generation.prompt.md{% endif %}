## General Testing Guidelines
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## Test Structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests appropriately
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern when applicable
- Keep tests focused and atomic
- Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable

## Mocking and Fixtures
- Use mocks and stubs appropriately
- Create reusable fixtures when needed
- Avoid over-mocking which can lead to brittle tests


## Test Quality
- Tests should be independent of each other
- Avoid test interdependencies
- Write tests that are fast to execute
- Tests should be easy to understand and maintain
- Avoid too many assertions in a single test

## Other Considerations
- Avoid useless comments in tests
